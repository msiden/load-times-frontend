# load-times-frontend

This is a simple demo project that measures the response times of a web site and counts the number of occurencies of a search phrase on that site. The result is stored in a database and presented in a table.

It consists of two separate repos:
* load-times-frontend (https://github.com/msiden/load-times-frontend) (This repo)
* load-times- backend (https://github.com/msiden/load-times-backend)

Run it as follows:
* Clone both repos to your local machine
* cd into /load-times-frontend
* Run: make run-full-stack
* Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser

You need to have Docker and docker-compose installed.
